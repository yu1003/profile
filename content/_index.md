## About Me
#### Hi, I'm Yu Yamashita!
I am currently doing a research internship at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/), where I am advised by [Asia J. Biega](https://asiabiega.github.io/).
Before MPI-SP, I received a Bachelor of Arts in Library and Information Science from the University of Tsukuba in 2023.<br>
